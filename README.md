<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

C++ program that analyzes the content of code files using regular expressions.
The program will receive through the command line the name of the input file and the name
from the output file:

```
./code_analyzer code.cc codescheme.txt
```

The input file will be a syntactically correct C++ code file. The file
output will summarize the structure of the input file: declared variables, loops used
, comments included as well as an indication of the existence or not of a main.

Regular expressions should be used to analyze the input source code
and extract the following information:

**1. Variable declaration:** declarations of variables of type int will be detected
as well as those of type double. It will be assumed that each variable declaration will be made in
a single line and that in each line we will have a single declaration. Therefore, 
two or more variables will not be declared on the same line nor will they be considered
variables declared within blocks as for loops because they are not found
declared on a separate line. For each variable it will be stored, in addition
of its type, its name, the line on which it is declared and whether or not it has been initialized in the
own statement. A control will be kept of how many variables of each type have been
defined in the program.

**2. Use of loops:** loops of type for and loops of type
while. For each loop detected, the type of loop and the line of code will be stored.
in which it has been found. In addition, control will be kept of the number of loops of
each type that have been used in the program.

**3. Main program:** it will be detected whether or not there is a main function in the code
analyzed source.

**4. Comments:** all comments on one line (//) and multiple lines will be detected.
The type of each comment will be stored, the
line/s in which each one is located as well as the content of the comment itself.
Furthermore, it will be taken into account that if at the beginning of the file there is a
comment, that comment will be taken by default as a description of the program
